/*
Suppose a subclass inherits a method implementation from a superclass, and
implements a Java interface (that's the "interface" keyword) that contains
a method with the same name and prototype.

(a)  Will Java compile the result?
(b)  What if the method declaration in the interface has a different return
     type?
(c)  What if the method declaration in the interface has the same return type,
     but a signature with a different parameter type?
(d)  What if the method declaration in the interface has the same return type,
     and the same number of parameters and parameter types, but those
     parameters have different names?
